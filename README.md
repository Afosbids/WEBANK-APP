## Building A Service Oriented Web Applications

### For Context

There are two projects to be built and you are expected to choose a project based on your POD. These projects are:

1. Digital Wallet System (eWallet) --> (POD A)
2. Online Banking System (weBank) --> (POD B)

A project description, features to implement and approach to follow are in `POD_A.md` and `POD_B.md` file respectively at the root of this project.

At this point you are expect to checkout `POD_A.md` or `POD_B.md` file depending on your POD.

Happy Hacking ...
